 # Jewelry Order Management – BI Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the order management process of a jewelry company.

The dataset (Excel file) includes order data such as:
- Customers
- Products (jewelry items)
- Order dates
- Quantities
- Prices
- Order status

Using Excel pivot tables and charts, I created a small BI-style dashboard that helps answer key business questions:

- Which jewelry products are sold the most?
- Who are the top customers?
- What is the monthly trend of sales?
- What is the distribution of orders by status (completed, canceled, in production, etc.)?

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, charts, basic dashboarding)
- Basic data cleaning and structuring

## Dashboard
The `/reports` folder includes:
- `dashboard.png` – main BI dashboard screenshot
- `pivot_tables.png` – supporting pivot tables

## Business Insights (examples)

Some example insights that can be drawn from the data:
- Identification of best-selling product categories
- Key customers contributing the most revenue
- Seasonal or monthly trends in orders
- Potential bottlenecks based on order status distribution

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real operational data, structure it, and transform it into visual and business insights using BI thinking.
